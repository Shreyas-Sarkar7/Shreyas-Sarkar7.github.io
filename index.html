            I'm Shreyas, a Secondary 4 student from Dunearn Secondary School
            with a strong passion for computers and technology.<br /><br />
            My journey into the tech world began at age 13, inspired by my
            brother's Arduino projects. Since then, I've been continuously
            exploring the field of computing.<br /><br />
            During my free time, I enjoy building fun mini projects using
